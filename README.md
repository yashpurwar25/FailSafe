**FAILSAFE** is an industry-grade predictive analytics platform that enables educators to identify students at risk of academic failure early in the term. Unlike traditional "black-box" ML models, FAILSAFE leverages **Explainable AI (XAI)** to provide precise reasons for every risk prediction, allowing for targeted, personalized interventions.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🧠 Predictive Intelligence
- **High-Accuracy Classification:** Powered by an XGBoost model optimized via Optuna Bayesian search.
- **Early Detection:** Analyzes early grades (G1, G2), absenteeism, and socio-economic factors to predict final outcomes.
- **Imbalance Handling:** Utilizes SMOTE to ensure the model is highly sensitive to "at-risk" students (high recall).

### 🔍 Explainable AI (XAI)
- **SHAP Integration:** Every prediction is decomposed using SHAP values, showing exactly which features (e.g., alcohol consumption, study time) increased or decreased the risk.
- **Automated Intervention Plans:** Generates a customized academic and behavioral support plan based on the top risk drivers for each student.

### 📊 Faculty Management Dashboard
- **Risk Analytics:** Visualizes overall class risk distribution and trend analysis using interactive charts.
- **Student Lifecycle Management:** Full CRUD capabilities to add, track, and delete student records.
- **Secure Access:** JWT-based authentication system with a dedicated registration and login workflow.
